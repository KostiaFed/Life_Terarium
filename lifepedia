Ancient lavender

It got its name because of its color.
I attribute this species to the 3rd generation. It fed on the remains of dead organisms, successfully searched for food and reproduced. Unique self-sacrifice. The colonies of this organism were quite large and were happily mowed down by predators, until this species received a gene that forced them to sacrifice themselves if they saw a predator, namely they exploded, taking a few more of their own and the attacking predator to the other world, but the main part the colony remained safe.
When this species completely defeated the predators, it atrophied most of the neurons and switched to photosynthesis.
Now lost because I didn't have the save view feature when I opened it.

Firstatam

II generation.
The first preserved species. He also ate leftovers. Unique in that it catalyzed evolution in a petri dish many times over, but as it turned out later, it abused a mathematical error in the code, so when I noticed and fixed it, it became a weak and very fragile, unremarkable species.

Dayhunter

I generation. Predator. It is unique in that it hunts exclusively during the day, as far as I understand, so it regulates its gluttony.

High Dayhunter

Dayhunter of the II generation, gained greater mobility and gave up cannibalism.
